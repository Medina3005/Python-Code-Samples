# Problem 1 – Print "Hello World"


# a = "Hello World"
# print(a)


# print("Hello World")
# I was trying to put two ways printing the Hello World output. In the first my example i give a variable first and then print the variable that gives Hello World output. 
# In the second part I just print the word "Hello World" that was the easiest way.



# a = "Hello World"
# print(a)


# print("Hello World")
# I was trying to put two ways printing the Hello World output. In the first my example i give a variable first and then print the variable that gives Hello World output.

# Problem 2 – Ask for the user's name and greet them


#!/usr/bin/env python
# username = input("Please enter your name:")
# user = "Medina"
# if username == user:
#     print("Welcome to the system")
# else:
#     print("Access denied")


# In my second part i just put my name in the variable and used if and else conditionals. I give only one variable - my name.When I run the code, first they asked me to
# enter the name, if i enter the correct name it will give the output of "Welcome to the system".
# But if i provide the wrong name, it will print Access denied. I just put only my name because for example in my computer i also have a password and
# when i put the correct name it will autamitaccly allow me to enter to the system.

# if username == user1:
#     print("Welcome to the system")
# elif username == user2:
#     print("Welcome to the system")
# else:
#     print("Access denied")


    # As it was in the instructions, i added only myself and instructor. My code work. When I enter my name or instructor anme it greets us.
