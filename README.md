Module 1: Lab Activity â€“ Commenting and Documentation

Part 1: Adding Comments to Python Files

conversion.py

This program converts values like temperature, weight, or distance.

Without comments, it may be hard to understand the code.

I added comments to:

Show the author's name.

Add the date of the last edit.

Explain what the program does.

Clarify key lines of code.

login.py

This program checks a username and password for login.

I added comments to:

Show the author's name and date.

Explain how the program works.

Describe how it checks credentials and handles errors.

average.py

This program calculates the average of numbers entered by the user.

I added comments to:

Show the author's name and date.

Explain how it collects input and calculates the average.

Describe how it rounds and displays the result.

Basic Python Concepts Learned in Module 1

In Module 1, I learned how to:

Print messages on the screen:

print("Hello World")

Get user input and display a message:

username = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", username)

Perform simple calculations:

num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
sum_result = num1 + num2
print("The sum is:", sum_result)



Part 2: Reviewing ReadMe Files

The README gives a basic description of Flaskr.

It includes a tutorial link for building the project.

It does not have step-by-step installation instructions, usage examples, or contribution guidelines.

Project: RedditBot (GitHub Repository)

Does this README include key information?

The README gives a short description of the project.

It has a link to an external tutorial but lacks:

Step-by-step setup instructions.
